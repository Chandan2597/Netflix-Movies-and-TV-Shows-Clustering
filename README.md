## **Project Summary**

### **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset related to Netflix content and perform clustering to identify patterns and similarities among the shows and movies available on the platform. The dataset contains attributes such as title, genre, release year, duration, rating, and more. By grouping similar content, we aim to uncover meaningful clusters that can offer valuable insights for content categorization, recommendation systems, and content acquisition strategies.

### **Data Preprocessing**

The initial step involves preprocessing the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This includes:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and addressing any missing values in the dataset.
2. **Removing Irrelevant Columns**: Eliminating columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
3. **Transforming Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations for better processing.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing attributes to enhance the dataset’s informational value.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

With the cleaned dataset, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. This includes:

1. **Visualizations**: Creating charts and graphs to visualize the distribution of variables.
2. **Statistical Summaries**: Summarizing key statistics to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Relationships**: Exploring relationships between different features to uncover any significant correlations.

### **Clustering Techniques**

Once the dataset is thoroughly analyzed, we will apply clustering algorithms to group similar Netflix shows and movies. The clustering process involves:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing appropriate clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering.
2. **Optimal Cluster Determination**: Using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. **Clustering Execution**: Implementing the chosen algorithms to form clusters of similar content.

### **Cluster Evaluation and Interpretation**

After forming the clusters, we will evaluate and interpret the results to understand the common characteristics within each group. This step includes:

1. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyzing the attributes and patterns within each cluster.
2. **Insights and Recommendations**: Providing insights based on the clustering results, which can inform content categorization and recommendation strategies for Netflix.

### **Presentation of Findings**

Finally, the findings and insights from the clustering analysis will be summarized and presented effectively. This includes:

1. **Visualizations**: Using charts, graphs, and other visual aids to communicate the outcomes clearly.
2. **Summary**: Providing a concise summary of the analysis and its implications.
3. **Recommendations**: Suggesting potential improvements or strategies based on the identified clusters to enhance user experience and content offerings.

### **Conclusion**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content landscape through clustering techniques. By identifying and grouping similar shows and movies, we can offer valuable insights that will aid Netflix in making informed decisions regarding content categorization, recommendations, and acquisition strategies.

## **Problem Statement**

### **Business Context**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

### In this project, we are required to do -

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Understanding what type content is available in different countries
* If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
* Clustering similar content by matching text-based features
